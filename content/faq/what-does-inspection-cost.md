Our **pre-purchase building inspections start from $450**, with the final price depending on:

**Property factors:**
- **Size** - Number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and overall square footage
- **Location** - Distance from our base on the Sunshine Coast
- **Age and type** - Older homes or unique construction may require additional time
- **Special features** - Pools, large sheds, or multiple dwellings

**New build stage inspections** are priced individually based on:
- Which stages you require
- Size and complexity of the build
- Package deals (discount for multiple stages)

**Why invest in an inspection?**

The cost of a building inspection is typically **less than 0.1%** of the property purchase price. Consider this:
- A $600,000 property = $450 inspection (0.075% of purchase price)
- Average repair savings identified = $5,000 - $50,000+
