A typical building inspection takes **2-3 hours** for an average-sized home, depending on the size and complexity of the property.

**Factors that affect inspection time:**
- **Property size** - Larger homes take longer
- **Age and condition** - Older properties or those in poor condition require more detailed examination
- **Access** - Some areas may be difficult to access, requiring additional time
- **Property type** - Multi-story homes, properties with pools, or complex structures take longer

**What happens during the inspection:**
1. External inspection of roof, walls, and site
2. Internal inspection of all accessible areas
3. Detailed examination of structural elements
4. Photography of key areas and defects
5. Note-taking and documentation

**Do I need to be present?**
You're welcome to attend, but it's not required. Many clients prefer to attend so they can ask questions and see issues firsthand. However, access to the property is all we need.

**When will I get my report?**
Your detailed report will be delivered within **48 hours** of the inspection.
