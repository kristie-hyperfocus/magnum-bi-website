## Why Inspect a New Build?

Even new homes can have defects. Builder warranties don't cover everything, and once the build is complete, it's harder and more expensive to fix issues. Our stage inspections help you:

- **Catch defects early** when they're easier to fix
- **Ensure building code compliance**
- **Protect your warranty rights**
- **Have peace of mind** throughout the build process
